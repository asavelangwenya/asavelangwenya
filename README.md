## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Asavela, I have a Diploma in Financial Information Systems and I am fascinated by the world of Data Analytics.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on various data analytics projects in different fields mostly using SQL to query data, while using Excel and PowerBI for visualizations.
- To upskill myself for market competitiveness I am currently learning python pandas so I can possess all the necessary tools I need to bring raw data to life.
    -   Here is a recent project I created https://github.com/asavelangwenya/Hospital-Management
